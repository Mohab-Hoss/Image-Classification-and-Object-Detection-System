The Image Classification and Object Detection System aims to build a deep learning-based solution for 
classifying images into predefined categories and detecting objects within images. The project will leverage 
powerful machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, and integrate cloud tools such 
as Azure for scalability and real-time deployment. # Image-Classification-and-Object-Detection-System
